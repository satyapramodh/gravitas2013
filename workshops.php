		<b>				Event Details</b>

These days downloading and playing games off the internet is too main-stream. Since the advent of public releases of game engines, creating your own game has never been easier. The workshop aims to expose and train the attendees in UNITY game engine at a basic level so they can create their own small scale 2D and 3D games. They’ll be guided through all the important stages of game designing and development as followed by industrial giants. Along with UNITY, supporting 3D modelling and material design softwares such as 3DS Max will also be taught.

“Mom says too old to be playing games? Well take it to the next level and create your own!!”
This Gravitas 2013, ISOI brings a workshop to all the gamers to go behind the scenes and see what goes into the making of those visually stunning and highly addictive games. Here’s a chance for those who have found some fault in every game to create their own perfect masterpiece. Register for two days of hardcore game designing, development using UNITY and of course – gaming.

				<b>Regulations</b>

•	Participants are requested to bring their laptop, external mice and a pen drive.
•	All required software, support files and documentation will be provided on spot.
•	The timing of the workshop will be 9am to 1pm (morning session) and 2pm to 5pm (evening session).
